# Book Search Engine

## Description

This is a fully functioning Google Books API search engine built with a GraphQL API on an Apollo Server using GraphQL queries and mutations to fetch and modify data. The app was built using the MERN stack, with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js runtime environment. The application is deployed to Heroku.

## Usage
